# DESERT BUS 3


This is the COMP460 senior design project with Sarah Davies and Elliot Rivers at Rice a while back.

Back then Monogame still requires XNA 4.0 and a Content project. I'm now trying to get this working again with Monogame 3.5.1 and hopefully port this to UWP or Xamarin.

The old 2D dynami shadow code we had doesn't work anymore with the new Content Pipeline. SO I'm looking at replacements of the lighting code and the console.

Lighting candidate: https://github.com/discosultan/penumbra

Console candidate: https://github.com/Discosultan/quake-console
