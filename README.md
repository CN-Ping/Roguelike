# DESERT BUS 3


This is the COMP460 senior design project created by Sarah Davies and Elliot Rivers and me at Rice a while ago.

Back then Monogame still required XNA 4.0 and a Content project. I'm now trying to get this working again with Monogame 3.5.1 and hopefully port this to UWP or Xamarin.

The old 2D dynamic shadow code we had doesn't work anymore with the new Content Pipeline. So I'm looking at replacements of the lighting code and the XNA console.

Console candidate: https://github.com/Discosultan/quake-console
